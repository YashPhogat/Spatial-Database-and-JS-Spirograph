# Spatial-Database-and-JS-Spirograph
A KML based short project where coordinates were plotted on Google Earth and spatial DB queries were executed.

Step 1. Collecting various coordinates 
Step 2. Plotting them as points on Google Map using KML files.
Step 3. PLot a Convex Hull from the collected points using Spatial DB querying and KML.
Step 4. Using Spatial DB queries find 5 nearest neighbours of a center node and plot them on Google Earth using KML file
Step 5. Using Javascript create a Spirograph 
Step 6. Plugin the coordinates of one of your points into the center of the Spirograph and let the JS script output corresponding points to plot a spirograph on map. Add these points to KML and visualize in Google Earth(.kml) and ArcGIS (.shapefile).
